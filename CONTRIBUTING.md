# Contributing to Island

Thanks for helping improve Island. Bug reports, small fixes, and focused feature
proposals are welcome.

## Before you start

Island runs inside the ArchIsland Quickshell shell, a copy of which is bundled
under `core/`. Use a working ArchIsland installation for visual and runtime checks. The root `manifest.json`
defines the bar plugin; `companion/guilhermerisu.notifications/` contains the
separate notification service. The plugin IDs (`guilhermerisu.island`,
`guilhermerisu.notifications`) are inherited from the original project and are
used by `install.sh`, `bin/island`, the QML IPC target and the companion scripts;
do not rename them without updating all of those together. Keep IDs and entry
points consistent with the QML and shell commands that refer to them.

For a bug report, include the ArchIsland version, the steps to reproduce, what you
expected, and what happened. Screenshots or short recordings help with visual
issues. Remove personal information from logs and screenshots before posting.

## Making a change

1. For broad changes to installation, removal, or user configuration, discuss
   the approach in an issue first.
2. Keep each pull request focused. Explain the behavior change and any new
   commands or dependencies.
3. Preserve user settings and local changes. When editing `shell.json` or menu
   overrides, keep unrelated entries intact and provide a clear removal path.
4. Do not edit ArchIsland's packaged files under `/usr/share/archisland/`. Use them as
   a reference only.

The main UI is in `Island.qml`, `components/`, and `views/`. Companion setup and
removal live in `companion/`. Update the README when a user-facing action,
dependency, or configuration path changes.

## Checking your work

From the repository root, run:

```sh
archisland plugin validate .
archisland plugin validate companion/guilhermerisu.notifications
bash -n companion/check.sh companion/install.sh companion/uninstall.sh
git diff --check
```

For visual changes, check the affected views in a running ArchIsland session and
include a screenshot in the pull request. For setup or removal changes, test a
fresh install, a repeat run, and `companion/uninstall.sh --dry-run`. Confirm that
unrelated user configuration survives. Do not run destructive setup or removal
checks against a session with changes you cannot restore.

In the pull request, summarize what changed, how you checked it, and any known
limitations. Do not include credentials, notification history, or other personal
state in fixtures or screenshots.
